### 4. Run System ✅
- **File**: `lib/run_system.py`
- **Features**:
  - Run state management with HP tracking
  - Skill card, item, and equipment integration
  - Fight progression (currently 5 fights per run)
  - Win/loss conditions with HP penalties
  - Automatic content unlocking based on performance

## How to Use the System

### Starting the Game
1. Run `python3 turn_play.py`
2. The main menu will appear with options to create or load profiles

### Creating a Profile
1. Click "New Profile"
2. Enter a profile name and press Enter or click "Create"
3. The profile will be created with starter content unlocked

### Starting a Run
1. Select a profile from the main menu
2. Choose a region (initially only "Tutorial" is available)
3. The game will start a combat session
4. After combat ends, return to region selection

### Profile Progression
- **Starter Content**: Basic skill cards, items, and equipment
- **Unlocking**: Win fights to unlock new content
- **Persistence**: All progress is automatically saved

```

## Current Limitations & Next Steps

### Current Limitations
1. **Simple Run Structure**: Currently just 5 fights in sequence
2. **Basic Combat**: No integration with skill cards/items yet
3. **Limited Content**: Only a few cards/items/equipment implemented
4. **No Map System**: No visual map or path selection

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Integrate Skill Cards**: Add skill card usage to combat system
2. **Add More Content**: Implement more skill cards, items, and equipment
3. **Visual Map**: Create a simple map visualization for run progression
4. **Equipment Selection**: Add pre-run equipment selection screen

### Future Enhancements
1. **Complex Map System**: Multiple paths, different node types
2. **Enemy Variety**: Different enemy types with unique abilities
3. **Shop System**: Purchase items and skill cards during runs
4. **Event System**: Random encounters and choices
5. **Boss Battles**: Multi-phase boss encounters

## Technical Notes

### Python Compatibility
- Fixed `StrEnum` import issue for Python 3.9
- All code tested and working on Python 3.9+

### Save System
- Profiles are saved as JSON files in `profiles/` directory
- Automatic saving after each run
- Profile data includes all meta-progression information

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new skill cards, items, and equipment
- Registry system allows dynamic content loading
- Modular design supports future features

## Testing the System

1. **Create a Profile**: Test profile creation and naming
2. **Start a Run**: Verify region selection and combat integration
3. **Check Persistence**: Verify profile data is saved and loaded correctly
4. **Test Content**: Verify starter content is properly unlocked

The system is now ready for the next phase of development, focusing on integrating the skill cards and items into the combat system and expanding the content library.
