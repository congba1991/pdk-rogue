# Enhanced Combat System - Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fight Game (`lib/enhanced_game.py`) ✅
- **Skill Card Integration**: Players can use skill cards during their turn
- **Item Effects**: Active items usable during combat, passive/triggered items work automatically
- **Equipment Effects**: Automatic equipment effects applied throughout combat
- **Same Core Engine**: Uses identical combat mechanics as the original game

### 2. Test Fight System (`test_fight.py`) ✅
- **Complete Configuration UI**: Select region, enemy, skill cards, items, equipment, and starting stats
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy to test different combinations and scenarios
- **Same Engine**: Uses the exact same `EnhancedFightGame` as the main game

### 3. Main Game Integration ✅
- **Updated Main Menu**: Now uses enhanced combat system
- **Profile Integration**: Automatically loads unlocked content from profiles
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same fight engine used in both test and main game

## Key Features

### Skill Card Usage
- **During Player Turn**: Click skill card buttons to use them
- **One-Time Use**: Most skill cards are consumed after use
- **Conditional Usage**: Cards check if they can be used before allowing activation
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons show if cards can be used or are disabled

### Item Effects
- **Active Items**: Clickable during player turn (e.g., Scrying Orb)
- **Passive Items**: Automatically trigger based on conditions (e.g., Lucky Charm blocks first damage)
- **Triggered Items**: Activate on specific events (e.g., Straight Bonus on straight plays)
- **Usage Tracking**: Active items show remaining uses

### Equipment Effects
- **Automatic Application**: Equipment effects work without player input
- **Damage Modification**: Equipment can modify damage taken/dealt
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Equipment responds to fight start/end, turn start, etc.
- **Visual Display**: Shows equipped equipment during combat

## How to Use

### Running the Test Fight System
```bash
python3 test_fight.py
```

**Configuration Options:**
1. **Skill Cards**: Select up to 5 skill cards to bring into combat
2. **Items**: Select up to 5 items (active, passive, or triggered)
3. **Equipment**: Select any number of equipment pieces
4. **Stats**: Configure starting HP for both player and AI (1-20)

### Running the Main Game
```bash
python3 turn_play.py
```

**Integration:**
- Creates profiles with starter content unlocked
- Automatically loads unlocked skill cards, items, and equipment
- Uses the same enhanced combat system as test fights

## Combat Mechanics

### Skill Card Examples

- **Sharp Mind**: See 4 discarded cards at fight start

## Technical Implementation

### Code Quality
- **Same Engine**: Both test and main game use `EnhancedFightGame`
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new skill cards, items, and equipment
- **Consistent Behavior**: Identical combat mechanics across all modes
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error checking

### UI Integration
- **Skill Card Buttons**: Right side of screen, show usage status
- **Item Buttons**: Below skill cards, show remaining uses
- **Equipment Display**: Shows equipped items without interaction
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback for all interactive elements

### Game State Management
- **Damage Tracking**: Equipment modifies damage taken/dealt
- **Effect Triggers**: Items respond to game events automatically
- **Resource Management**: Skill cards and items are consumed appropriately
- **Turn Management**: Extra turns and turn order handled correctly

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Testing
1. **No Items/Equipment**: Test basic combat mechanics
2. **Skill Cards Only**: Test skill card usage and effects
3. **Items Only**: Test passive and active item effects
4. **Equipment Only**: Test automatic equipment effects

### Advanced Testing
1. **Full Loadout**: Test all systems together
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with maximum items, low HP, etc.
3. **Effect Interactions**: Test how different effects combine
4. **Balance Testing**: Test different HP configurations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **More Content**: Add more skill cards, items, and equipment
2. **AI Integration**: Make AI use skill cards and items
3. **Visual Polish**: Add animations and better visual feedback
4. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for actions

### Future Enhancements
1. **Run Integration**: Connect combat to the roguelike run system
2. **Enemy Variety**: Different enemy types with unique abilities
3. **Boss Battles**: Multi-phase boss encounters
4. **Advanced Effects**: More complex skill card and item interactions
